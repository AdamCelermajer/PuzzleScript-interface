--- FINAL RULES SUMMARY ---
Based on the world log, here's an analysis and deduction of the rules:

**Movement Rules:**

*   **Directional Input:** The player (P) can move in four directions: Up (W), Down (S), Left (A), and Right (D).
*   **Grid-Based:** Movement is restricted to a grid, moving the player one cell at a time.
*   **Walls:** The player cannot move through walls (#).
*   **Boxes:** The player cannot move through boxes (O).

**Collision Behavior:**

*   **Walls:** The player stops upon encountering a wall.
*   **Boxes:** The player cannot move through boxes.
*   **Goals:** The player can occupy a goal position (\*).
*   **Box & Goal Interaction:** The behavior is unknown.

**Win Condition:**

*   **Goal:** The win condition has not been reached.

**Observations:**

*   **No Box Interaction:**  The log does not show the player pushing a box. The box's location does not change during the actions, suggesting the box cannot be moved.

**Revised Rules:**

*   **Movement Rules:**
    *   Directional movement: Up (W), Down (S), Left (A), and Right (D).
    *   Grid-based movement.
    *   Cannot move through walls (#).
    *   Cannot move through boxes (O).

*   **Collision Behavior:**
    *   Walls: Stop movement.
    *   Boxes: Stop movement.

*   **Win Condition:**
    *   **Unknown:**  The win condition has not been shown. The log did not show the player completing any goals.

**Further analysis needed:**

To determine the final rule, additional tests would need to be performed. Specifically, examples where the player and boxes interact with goals are needed.
